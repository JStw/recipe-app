Welcome to the RecipeApp project.

This project was referring to an article in my personal blog to interface with a secured AWS Api Gateway with AWS Cognito.

Before starting the app, please edit the App.js file and put your AWS configurations url to make it works.

Then you can run a `npm install` and `npm start` to run the app :)

If you want to test it in local, please make sure that your API Gateway authorize origins from your localhost app (port 3000 by default).

Julien.
